# LOON — SPAR-Kit

> *The Mirror: looking back at what the thread promised.*

---

## Entry: 2026-02-27

**Trigger**: SPAR protocol evolved from v7.0 to v8.0 in this session (SPARs #32, #33). This is the single most impactful lifecycle event for spar-kit: the protocol the kit implements has gained 3 new capabilities. Also flagged as LOOM L1 (P0 orphan: most active repo, no reflection).

### Thread Check (Did the NOOL hold?)

| NOOL Layer | Expected (NOOL v0.1) | Actual | Drift |
|------------|---------------------|--------|-------|
| **Intent (WHY)** | "End isolated reasoning by giving everyone a methodology for structured disagreement." Stage 1 of five-stage SaaS rocket. | Still true. But the scope has expanded: SPAR is no longer just "structured disagreement," it's now a full reasoning methodology (IoT-AoT-CoT stack). The five-stage rocket framing remains. | Drifted (deepened: from disagreement tool to reasoning infrastructure) |
| **Abstraction (WHAT TYPE)** | DESIGN: Multi-surface implementation. NEWS compass, PERSONALITY framework, SPARKIT protocol (7 steps), TESSERACT (504 combos). Two backends. MCP server. | Still correct at the implementation level. But the protocol layer has evolved: 7 steps + NOOL lifecycle binding + debate lineage. The NOOL describes v7 architecture accurately but is now behind the v8 protocol. | Drifted (protocol evolved, implementation hasn't caught up yet) |

### Chain Audit (v7 → v8 Gap)

| Component | v7 State (NOOL describes) | v8 Additions (not in NOOL) | Gap |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----|
| Protocol steps | 7 steps (SCOPE→POPULATE→ANNOUNCE→RUMBLE→KNIT→INTERROGATE→TRANSMIT) | Same 7 + Step 0 (NOOL), Step 1b/1c (ecosystem context, lifecycle binding), Step 5b (resonance check), Step 7b/7c (NOOL delta, lineage) | NOOL needs update |
| Reasoning stack | AoT (Abstraction of Thought) only | IoT-AoT-CoT trilayer (Intent-Abstraction-Chain) | NOOL needs update |
| NOOL integration | None | Every debate can cite NOOLs, propose deltas, track lineage | NOOL needs update |
| GRACE check | Not formalized | G-R-A-C-E bias check before each round | Implementation may need update |
| SPARED coaching | Not in NOOL | 5-phase invisible coaching layer (GROUND→FLOW→BURN→EXPAND→RETURN) | Documentation gap |
| Debate lineage | None | `lineage: { parent: "SPAR #NN", trigger: "why", children: [] }` | Implementation may need update |

### Unexpected Signals

| Signal | Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `.agent/workflows/spar.md` became the canonical protocol spec | Session evolution | The spar.md workflow (v8.0) now contains protocol details that should live in the kit's methodology docs, not just the agent workflow. Two sources of truth risk. |
| SPAR debates (#36-#41) created ecosystem-wide artifacts | This session | SPARs drove /steal workflow creation, /research rewrite, Let's STEAL book architecture. The kit's impact expanded far beyond "structured disagreement." |
| Let's STEAL franchise pattern | SPAR #39 | spar-kit → Let's SPAR established the template that steal-kit → Let's STEAL now follows. The kit is the seed of a franchise pattern. |
| OpenRouter multi-model validated at $0.00/run | Prior session | R1-Kimi-70B config scored 26.5/30, making SPAR accessible without API costs. This changes the accessibility story. |
| 140+ tests passing | Prior development | Testing infrastructure is mature, which makes v8 implementation safer. |

### The Knot 🪢

> *SPAR silently evolved from a disagreement tool to reasoning infrastructure, and neither the kit nor the book know it yet.*
