# நூல் / NOOL — SPAR-Kit

> *The Reasoning Thread: a record of INTENT (why), ABSTRACTION (what type), and CHAIN (how).*

## நோக்கம் / Intent (Soul: WHY)

End isolated reasoning by giving everyone, humans and AI, reasoning infrastructure accessed through structured disagreement. SPAR-Kit is the Body (implementation) of the SPAR methodology Soul: CLI, Web, MCP, WASM. The v8.0 protocol adds IoT-AoT-CoT (Intent-Abstraction-Chain) as a three-layer reasoning stack, elevating SPAR from a debate tool to a complete reasoning methodology. Stage 1 of the five-stage SaaS rocket (Book → CLI → Web → MCP → WASM).

## வடிவம் / Abstraction (Mind: WHAT TYPE)

**DESIGN**: Multi-surface implementation of a single methodology. NEWS compass (4 directions), PERSONALITY framework (11 archetypes, 163 personas), SPARKIT protocol (7 steps), STASH modes (5 execution contexts), TESSERACT configuration (504 combos). Two execution backends: Claude-native (fast) and OpenRouter multi-model ($0.00/run, 100% validated). MCP server for agentic integration. Powers the SPAR (Challenge) phase of the DMS Heptagon lifecycle.

## சங்கிலி / Chain (Body: HOW)

`npm install -g sparkit` → TUI Mission Control → Builder wizard → 3-round RUMBLE → KNIT synthesis → TRANSMIT verdict. 140+ tests passing. Debate sessions auto-saved to `~/.spar/sessions/`. Integrates with DMG (decision capture) and VAULT-KIT (ZK-Dissent).
