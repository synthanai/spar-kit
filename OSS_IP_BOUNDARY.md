# OSS/IP Boundary Policy

**Version**: 1.0  
**License**: MIT (for OSS components)  
**Date**: March 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

This repository is an **open standard/toolkit** within the SYNTHAI ecosystem.

This policy defines what is **Open Source (MIT)** vs **Proprietary IP**.

---

## 2. What is OSS (MIT)

- Core specifications, schemas, and protocols
- Reference implementations (SDKs, CLIs)
- Methodology documentation (manifestos, cheatsheets, FAQs)
- Validators, test vectors, conformance suites
- Tutorials and examples

---

## 3. What is Proprietary IP

- **Books** (published content, narratives, illustrations)
- **Workshop content** (facilitator guides, student workbooks, assessment rubrics)
- **Hosted services** (SaaS, multi-tenant infrastructure)
- **Canon personas** (hand-crafted, culturally grounded personas)
- **Verified datasets** (curated training data, premium benchmarks)
- **Enterprise controls** (SSO, RBAC, compliance, audit logs)
- **GPT/AI system prompts** (coaching cycles, persona architectures)

---

## 4. Trademarks

Even when code/spec is MIT:

- **Trademarks are not granted**
- Names and logos are protected
- You may implement freely but may not claim "official" status without permission

---

## 5. The Boundary Rule of Thumb

> **If it defines the standard or enables local usage → OSS (MIT)**
>
> **If it provides hosted trust, verified content, books, workshops, or enterprise governance → Proprietary IP**
