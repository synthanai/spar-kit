# AI vs. Human Decision Boundaries

**Document**: TASK-121  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2026-01-14  
**Purpose**: Establish clear boundaries for AI vs. human decision-making domains

---

## 🎯 Core Premise

> **AI provides synthesis. Humans provide judgment.**

SPAR-Kit is designed to enhance human decision-making, not replace it. This document codifies the specific boundary between what AI should do and what humans must do.

## 📊 The AI-Human Decision Matrix

### What AI Does (Synthesis)

| AI Responsibility | Description | Example |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Aggregate perspectives** | Collect and organize viewpoints | "Here are 4 persona positions on this decision" |
| **Surface tensions** | Identify where views conflict | "The Pragmatist and Visionary disagree on timeline" |
| **Generate options** | Present alternatives discovered | "Three paths emerged from the debate" |
| **Highlight risks** | Flag potential failure modes | "INTERROGATE found 5 watch-outs" |
| **Synthesize themes** | Find convergence patterns | "All personas agree on X, diverge on Y" |
| **Provide confidence** | Indicate certainty levels | "65% confidence based on convergence/reasoning/evidence" |

### What Humans Do (Judgment)

| Human Responsibility | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Frame the question** | Define what decision matters | "Should we enter market X?" |
| **Select perspectives** | Choose which personas debate | "Include Ethics + Innovation" |
| **Weight priorities** | Decide what matters most | "Security > speed for this decision" |
| **Resolve tensions** | Choose when views conflict | "I side with the Pragmatist here" |
| **Accept or override** | Final approval of recommendations | "Modify: add 3-month pilot phase" |
| **Take accountability** | Own the decision outcome | "I decided to proceed" |
| **Execute action** | Implement the decision | "Team, we're moving forward with X" |

## 🛑 Absolute Boundaries

### AI Will NEVER:

1. **Make final decisions** without human approval
2. **Execute actions** on behalf of users
3. **Hide uncertainty** from users
4. **Suppress minority viewpoints** from synthesis
5. **Store or transmit sensitive data** beyond session scope
6. **Claim certainty** when data is insufficient
7. **Override human judgment** even when confidence is high

### Humans MUST Always:

1. **Review every recommendation** before acting
2. **Apply contextual judgment** AI cannot access
3. **Consider ethical implications** beyond AI analysis
4. **Accept accountability** for decisions made
5. **Validate assumptions** AI has made
6. **Check for missing perspectives** AI may not represent
7. **Document their reasoning** when overriding AI

## 📋 Decision Domain Classification

### 🟢 AI Can Recommend (Human Approves)

| Domain | Why AI Helps | Human Role |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Strategic planning | Aggregates perspectives | Final direction |
| Product roadmaps | Surfaces trade-offs | Priority decisions |
| Team structure | Explores options | Fit/culture judgment |
| Investment priorities | Risk analysis | Risk appetite decision |
| Tech stack choices | Technical comparison | Context + legacy |

### 🟡 AI Assists (Human Leads)

| Domain | Why AI Helps | Human Role |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Hiring decisions | Reduce bias, surface candidates | Cultural fit, potential |
| Performance reviews | Data aggregation | Relationship context |
| Partnership choices | Due diligence support | Trust judgment |
| Pricing decisions | Market analysis | Brand positioning |

### 🔴 AI Provides Context (Human Decides)

| Domain | Why AI is Limited | Human Role |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Medical treatment | Liability, individualization | Doctor's clinical judgment |
| Legal strategy | Professional responsibility | Attorney's expertise |
| Safety-critical systems | Failure consequences | Engineer's certification |
| Vulnerable populations | Power dynamics | Ethical oversight |
| Crisis management | Real-time context | Executive authority |
