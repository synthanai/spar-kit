## 📈 Benefit Analysis

### Quantifiable Benefits

| Benefit | Value | Calculation |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Time saved per decision | 2-4 hours | Research + deliberation time |
| Decisions per user/month | 5-10 | Typical knowledge worker |
| Time saved per user/month | 10-40 hours | |
| Value per hour | $50-150 | Loaded labor cost |
| **Monthly value per user** | **$500-6,000** | |

### 10-User Organization

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Monthly time saved | 100 hours | 400 hours |
| Monthly value created | $5,000 | $60,000 |
| Annual value created | $60,000 | $720,000 |
| **Payback period** | **3 weeks** | **<1 week** |

### Intangible Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Decision quality improvement | Unmeasured but significant |
| Reduced decision regret | Fewer costly reversals |
| Audit trail value | Compliance, learning |
| Bias reduction | Fairer outcomes |
| Documentation | Knowledge capture |

## 📊 ROI Calculation

### Conservative Scenario

```
Initial Investment:    $3,600
Annual Maintenance:    $2,000
Annual Benefit (10 users): $60,000

Year 1 ROI: ($60,000 - $3,600 - $2,000) / $5,600 = 970%
Year 2+ ROI: $60,000 / $2,000 = 2,900%
```

### Optimistic Scenario

```
Initial Investment:    $3,600
Annual Maintenance:    $2,000
Annual Benefit (10 users): $720,000

Year 1 ROI: ($720,000 - $5,600) / $5,600 = 12,750%
```

## ⚖️ Risk-Adjusted Analysis

### Risks to Benefits

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Low adoption | 20% | High | Training, champions |
| Poor decisions | 10% | Medium | Human override |
| Misuse | 5% | Medium | Guardrails, audit |

### Risk-Adjusted ROI

Applying 30% discount for uncertainty:

```
Conservative Scenario Risk-Adjusted: 670% Year 1 ROI
Optimistic Scenario Risk-Adjusted: 8,900% Year 1 ROI
```

**Still massively positive.**
