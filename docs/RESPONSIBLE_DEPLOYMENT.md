## 🗣️ Communication Guidelines

### What to Tell Employees

**DO Say:**
- "SPAR-Kit helps you explore decisions more thoroughly"
- "It surfaces perspectives you might not have considered"
- "You remain the decision-maker"
- "The tool is designed to enhance your judgment, not replace it"

**DON'T Say:**
- "SPAR-Kit will make decisions for you"
- "We're implementing AI to increase efficiency"
- "This will reduce headcount"
- "Trust the AI recommendation"

### Sample Announcement

```
We're introducing SPAR-Kit, a decision support tool that helps 
you explore different perspectives on important decisions.

Here's what it does:
• Surfaces viewpoints you might not have considered
• Provides structured analysis with confidence scores
• Documents your reasoning for future reference

Here's what it doesn't do:
• Make decisions for you
• Replace your judgment
• Track your performance
• Access your personal information

You remain fully in control. SPAR-Kit is here to help you 
think more thoroughly, not to think for you.
```

## ⚠️ Red Lines: Never Deploy For

### Prohibited Use Cases

| Use Case | Why Prohibited |
|----------|---------------|
| Performance evaluation | Power imbalance, bias risk |
| Hiring/firing decisions | Legal liability, ethical concerns |
| Surveillance of employees | Privacy violation, trust destruction |
| Automated policy enforcement | Removes human judgment |
| Compensation decisions | Fairness, legal compliance |

### Warning Signs

Stop deployment if you observe:
- Employees feeling surveilled
- Pressure to "trust the AI"
- Resistance to override recommendations
- Focus on speed over quality
- Fear of disagreeing with AI

## 📈 Success Metrics

### What to Measure

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| User satisfaction | ≥4.0/5.0 | Monthly survey |
| Decision quality improvement | Subjective improvement reported | Quarterly retrospective |
| Override rate | 10-30% | System metrics |
| Training completion | 100% | LMS tracking |
| Adoption rate | ≥80% of decisions | Usage analytics |

### What NOT to Measure

| Metric | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| Decisions per hour | Incentivizes speed over quality |
| Time to decision | Same |
| Compliance with AI | Encourages rubber-stamping |
| Individual usage ranking | Creates unhealthy competition |
