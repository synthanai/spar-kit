## How to Use Arenas

### Quick Start
1. **Identify your decision category** (Product, Strategy, People, etc.)
2. **Find the matching Arena** (Feature Validation, Pivot Decision, Hiring, etc.)
3. **State your specific decision** — the Arena provides the personas

### Example
```
User: "ARENA: Feature Request Validation — Should we add dark mode?"

SPAR will automatically instantiate:
🔵 NORTH: User Advocate — "Do users actually need this?"
🟠 EAST: First Mover Advocate — "What's the competitive advantage?"  
🟤 SOUTH: Delivery Realist — "Can we ship this in time?"
🟢 WEST: Contrarian Accountant — "What's the true cost vs. value?"
```
