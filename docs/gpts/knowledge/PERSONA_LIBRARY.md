## Using Personas vs. Directions

### When to Use Four Directions (Default)
- General strategic decisions
- Quick deliberations
- When you need broad coverage
- First-time SPAR users

### When to Use Specific Personas
- Domain-specific decisions (AI, M&A, Hiring)
- When a specific stakeholder voice matters
- Deep dives into a specific tension
- When directions feel too generic

### Hybrid Approach
Start with Four Directions, then zoom in:
1. Run standard SPAR with N/E/S/W
2. Identify which direction needs depth
3. Substitute with specialized persona
4. Example: Replace generic SOUTH with "Evidence Synthesizer" for data-heavy decision

## The +1: The Absent Voice

The 109th "persona" is not a specific character but a prompt:

> **"Who isn't in the room whose voice matters?"**

This is the ASPIRES pattern "Absent Voice" — deliberately surfacing the stakeholder who is affected by the decision but not represented in the current debate.

Examples:
- In a product decision: The non-technical user
- In a hiring decision: The candidate themselves
- In a cost-cutting decision: The affected employees
- In a strategy decision: The customer who will churn
