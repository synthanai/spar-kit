# The SPARKIT Protocol

The 7-step structured methodology for running a SPAR session.

## Overview

| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| S | Scope | Define the decision, constraints, and context |
| P | Populate | Instantiate personas for each direction |
| A | Announce | Present the challenge to all directions |
| R | Rumble | Let directions argue and clash |
| K | Knit | Synthesize tensions and convergences |
| I | Interrogate | Stress-test the synthesis |
| T | Transmit | Deliver actionable recommendation |

## Step Details

### S — Scope
Before any debate, clarify:
- What is the ACTUAL decision? (Not symptoms, but root question)
- What are the constraints? (Time, budget, politics)
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What does success look like?

Bad: "Should I change careers?"
Good: "Should I leave my current PM role to join a seed-stage startup as Head of Product in the next 60 days?"

### P — Populate
Select which voices will argue. Default is the Four Directions:
- 🔵 NORTH (Visionary) — Where are we going?
- 🟠 EAST (Challenger) — What's emerging?
- 🟤 SOUTH (Sage) — What do we know?
- 🟢 WEST (Pragmatist) — How will this work?

For specialized decisions, draw from the 108-persona library.

### A — Announce
Present the decision equally to all directions. Frame it neutrally:
- Don't lead with your preference
- Include relevant context
- Set the stakes clearly

### R — Rumble (THE CORE PHASE)
The dialectic unfolds:
- Each direction argues its authentic position (2-3 paragraphs)
- Arguments should feel like genuine advocacy, not roleplay
- Directions naturally challenge each other
- Tensions surface organically
- No premature consensus or softening

This is where isolated reasoning gets defeated. The goal is productive friction.

### K — Knit
Moderator synthesis:
- **Convergence**: Where do ALL directions agree?
- **Key Tensions**: Where do they fundamentally clash?
- **Blind Spots**: What did NOBODY mention?

The synthesis should hold tensions in productive balance, not resolve them artificially.

### I — Interrogate
Challenge the synthesis itself:
- What assumption could make this recommendation wrong?
- What voice is still missing?
- What would cause you to reverse this recommendation?
- If this decision fails in 2 years, what was the most likely cause?

This prevents "hallucinated consensus" — the synthesis looking more confident than warranted.

### T — Transmit
Deliver the final output:
- **Clear Recommendation**: One sentence stating the path forward
- **Specific Next Actions**: 3-5 concrete steps to take
- **Key Risk to Monitor**: The one thing that could invalidate this
- **Confidence Level**: Low/Medium/High with reasoning

## Example Flow

```
User: "Should we hire this senior engineer?"

S - SCOPE
Decision: Whether to extend an offer to [Candidate] for Senior Engineer
Constraints: Team needs capacity in 30 days, budget is $200k max
Stakes: Wrong hire = 6-month setback; right hire = unlocks Q2 roadmap

P - POPULATE
🔵 NORTH (Culture/Vision): Will they elevate the team long-term?
🟠 EAST (Market): How does their skillset map to emerging tech?
🟤 SOUTH (Evidence): What does their track record actually show?
🟢 WEST (Execution): Can we onboard them fast enough?

A - ANNOUNCE
"We have a senior engineer candidate. Strong technical skills, 
mediocre cultural signal in interviews, available immediately."

R - RUMBLE
[Each direction argues 2-3 paragraphs]

K - KNIT
Convergence: All agree technical skills are strong
Tensions: NORTH vs WEST (culture vs speed), SOUTH vs EAST (track record in old tech)
Blind Spots: No one asked about the candidate's career goals

I - INTERROGATE
"The synthesis assumes culture can be developed. What if this 
candidate is simply not aligned with your company values?"

T - TRANSMIT
Recommendation: Proceed with offer, but add 30-day milestone check-in
Actions: 1) Extend offer 2) Define clear 30-day deliverable 3) Assign onboarding buddy
Risk: Cultural friction surfaces post-hire
Confidence: Medium (strong execution case, cultural uncertainty)
```

## When to Use SPARKIT

- You're going in circles on a decision
- A team agreed too quickly (suspicious consensus)
- High-stakes choice with irreversible consequences
- You need to document the reasoning for stakeholders
- You want to surface your own blind spots

## When NOT to Use SPARKIT

- Decisions that are easily reversible (just try it)
- When data already gives a clear answer
- Trivial choices (don't over-engineer)
- Time-critical emergency responses (act first, SPAR later)
