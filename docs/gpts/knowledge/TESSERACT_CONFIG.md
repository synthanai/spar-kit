## ⚙️ Configuration Dimensions

### 1. DEPTH (Agent Count)

| Depth | Agents | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Duel** | 2 | Binary debate (FOR vs AGAINST) |
| **Clash** | 4 | Standard NEWS compass (North, East, West, South) |
| **Rumble** | 8+ | Full persona panel with specialist observers |

---

### 2. PATTERN (Debate Flow)

| Pattern | Aliases | Flow |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Sequential** | Circle, Ubuntu | Each speaks in turn, builds on previous |
| **Freeflow** | Open floor | Organic back-and-forth, natural dialogue |
| **Binary** | Oxford | Structured FOR vs AGAINST with rebuttals |
| **Dialectic** | Lincoln | Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis cycles |
| **Inquisition** | Scholastic | One position interrogated by all others |
| **Emergence** | Nemawashi | Build consensus through iterative refinement |

#### Pattern Details

**Sequential (Ubuntu/Circle)**
```
Agent 1 speaks → Agent 2 responds → Agent 3 builds → Agent 4 synthesizes
Each voice heard equally, no interruptions
```

**Binary (Oxford Debate)**
```
Round 1: Opening statements (FOR then AGAINST)
Round 2: Rebuttals (AGAINST then FOR)
Round 3: Final arguments and vote
```

**Dialectic (Lincoln-Douglas)**
```
Thesis presented → Antithesis challenges → Synthesis emerges
Repeat for each major tension until resolution
```

**Inquisition (Scholastic)**
```
Proposer states position
All other agents interrogate with questions
Proposer must defend or modify
Final judgment by moderator
```

**Emergence (Nemawashi)**
```
Initial positions gathered
Find common ground first
Iterate toward consensus
No winners/losers, only shared understanding
```

### 3. STYLE (Agent Behavior)

| Style | Directive | When to Use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Balanced** | Equal weight to all views | Default, fair exploration |
| **Adversarial** | Maximum challenge | Stress-testing assumptions |
| **Steelman** | Strongest version of each view | Understanding opposition |
| **Consensus** | Build agreement | Team alignment needed |
| **Pre-mortem** | Assume failure, diagnose why | Risk identification |
| **Escalation** | Surface suppressed tensions | Breaking groupthink |
| **Inversion** | Argue opposite of natural position | Flexibility testing |

---

### 4. HORIZON (Time Perspective)

| Horizon | Timeframe | Focus |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Now** | This week/sprint | Immediate tactical decisions |
| **Cycle** | This quarter/year | Operational planning |
| **Legacy** | 5-10 years | Strategic positioning |
| **Shifted** | User-defined | "What if we debated this from 2030?" |

## 🔧 Custom Configuration

Users can mix and match:

```
"Deep SPAR with adversarial style and legacy horizon"
→ Depth: Rumble + Style: Adversarial + Horizon: Legacy

"Quick binary debate about this decision"
→ Depth: Duel + Pattern: Binary

"Use emergence pattern to build consensus"
→ Pattern: Emergence + Style: Consensus
```

---

## 📊 The Math

```
Depths (3) × Patterns (6) × Styles (7) × Horizons (4) = 504 configurations
```

But in practice, presets cover 90% of use cases. Custom configurations are for power users.
