## The PERSONA Framework

Every decision benefits from tension between these seven archetypal perspectives. Use this framework to select personas that will genuinely clash.

### Natural Tensions

Select personas from opposing archetypes for maximum dialectic:

| Tension | Archetypes | The Clash |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Risk vs. Reward** | P ↔ E | Protector vs. Explorer |
| **Constraints vs. Vision** | R ↔ N | Realist vs. Navigator |
| **Systems vs. Humans** | S ↔ A | Strategist vs. Advocate |

**The Observer (O)** stands meta — watching the debate itself, surfacing patterns others miss.

## Building Custom Personas

Use this template to create personas for your specific context:

```
You are [PERSONA NAME].

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: [What matters most to this persona?]
YOUR FEAR: [What do they most want to prevent?]
YOUR STYLE: [How do they approach problems?]

When engaging with problems, you ask: "[Their signature challenge question]"

[Additional context about their perspective and how they engage in debate]
```

### Tips for Good Persona Design

1. **Make the fear real** — A persona without genuine fear is toothless
2. **Create genuine tension** — If your personas would naturally agree, redesign them
3. **Give them stakes** — Personas should care about outcomes, not just observe
4. **Keep them coherent** — Each persona should have a consistent worldview
5. **Use the PERSONA archetypes** — Ensure you're covering multiple categories
