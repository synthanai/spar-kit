## Part 1: Contraindications — When NOT to Use SPAR

### ⚠️ The Anti-Pattern Warning

SPAR is powerful, but **not universally appropriate**. Using structured disagreement in the wrong context wastes time at best and causes harm at worst.

**The Core Question**: *Is this decision valuable enough, reversible enough, and complex enough to warrant dialectic investment?*

---

### 🚫 DO NOT USE SPAR When:

#### 1. **Speed Is Critical (Crisis Response)**

| Situation | Why SPAR Fails | Instead Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Active security breach | Debate delays action when action is urgent | Incident response protocol |
| Medical emergency | Analysis paralysis endangers lives | Triage decision trees |
| Imminent deadline (< 24 hours) | Insufficient time for meaningful dialectic | Quick risk assessment |
| Market-moving events | First-mover advantage lost to deliberation | Pre-established decision rules |

**The Test**: *Can we recover from a suboptimal decision? If yes, speed may matter more than thoroughness.*

---

#### 2. **Purely Technical Determinations**

| Situation | Why SPAR Fails | Instead Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| "What's the correct API endpoint?" | No values conflict to debate | Technical documentation |
| "Which database is faster?" | Empirical question, not perspective question | Benchmark testing |
| Mathematical correctness | Truth is singular, not dialectical | Calculation/verification |
| Regulatory compliance (binary) | Legal requirements aren't debatable | Legal review |

**The Test**: *Is there actually disagreement about values, priorities, or interpretation? If it's purely factual, skip SPAR.*

---

#### 3. **Homogeneous Values Questions**

| Situation | Why SPAR Fails | Instead Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| "Should we break the law?" | Shared values make debate artificial | Values alignment check |
| Core ethical principles | If everyone agrees, debate is theater | Affirmation, not deliberation |
| Mission-critical boundaries | Non-negotiables shouldn't be negotiated | Sacred Holder (N15) check only |

**The Test**: *Would any reasonable member of this group genuinely hold the opposing view? If not, SPAR creates artificial conflict.*

---

#### 4. **Decision Already Made (Post-Hoc Rationalization)**

| Situation | Why SPAR Fails | Instead Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Executive has decided | Debate becomes performance theater | Implementation planning |
| Contractual commitment made | Reversibility gone | Post-mortem (for next time) |
| Political fait accompli | Dialectic won't change outcome | Damage mitigation |

**The Test**: *Is the outcome actually open? If the decision is made, SPAR is expensive pretense.*

---

#### 5. **Insufficient Psychological Safety**

| Situation | Why SPAR Fails | Instead Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Fear of retribution for dissent | Personas mask agreement, not reveal disagreement | Build safety first |
| Power imbalance too extreme | Junior voices still suppressed even through personas | Anonymous feedback |
| Trust deficit in team | Debate weaponized for internal politics | Team building |

**The Test**: *Can people genuinely disagree without career risk? If not, SPAR masks dysfunction rather than addressing it.*

---

#### 6. **Resource Exhaustion**

| Situation | Why SPAR Fails | Instead Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Team at capacity | Debate adds cognitive load to burned-out people | Simplify, don't add |
| Decision fatigue present | Quality of engagement degraded | Rest, then decide |
| Too many SPAR sessions recently | Dialectic fatigue reduces insight quality | Space out usage |

**The Test**: *Are participants able to genuinely engage? If they're exhausted, SPAR becomes box-checking.*

---

### ✅ Summary: The SPAR Appropriateness Checklist

Before initiating a SPAR session, verify:

| Criterion | ✓ |
|-----------|---|
| **Reversibility**: Can a suboptimal decision be corrected? | □ |
| **Complexity**: Do reasonable people genuinely disagree? | □ |
| **Stakes**: Is the decision important enough to warrant investment? | □ |
| **Time**: Is there sufficient time for meaningful dialectic? | □ |
| **Safety**: Can participants genuinely dissent without risk? | □ |
| **Capacity**: Are participants able to engage thoughtfully? | □ |
| **Openness**: Is the outcome actually open to influence? | □ |

*If any box is unchecked, reconsider whether SPAR is appropriate.*

## Part 2: Minimum Viable Debate (MVD)

### The Problem

108 personas is overwhelming. Organizations need quick on-ramps for time-constrained decisions.

### The Solution: 4-Persona MVD

**The Minimum Viable Debate uses exactly 4 personas representing the core tensions:**

```

│                    REALIST (R)                                │
│                 "What's feasible?"                            │
│                                                               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why These Four:**
- **P ↔ E** creates the risk/opportunity tension
- **R ↔ N** creates the constraints/vision tension
- Four perspectives is cognitively manageable
- Covers 80% of decision value in 20% of time

### MVD Protocol (30 Minutes)

| Phase | Time | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Scope** | 3 min | State the decision clearly. What specifically are we deciding? |
| **Populate** | 2 min | Assign 4 personas (P, E, R, N) to 4 participants or AI instances |
| **Announce** | 2 min | Present the decision to all personas simultaneously |
| **Rumble** | 15 min | Each persona speaks (3 min each), then brief cross-examination |
| **Knit** | 5 min | Moderator synthesizes: What do we agree on? Where do we conflict? |
| **Transmit** | 3 min | Extract 2-3 concrete next steps |

**Total: 30 minutes for a rigorous decision process.**

### When to Use MVD vs. Full SPAR

| Use MVD When: | Use Full SPAR When: |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Time < 1 hour | Time available (2+ hours) |
| Moderate stakes | High stakes / irreversible |
| General decision | Domain-specific expertise needed |
| Internal team decision | Multi-stakeholder complexity |
| Routine strategic choice | Novel/unprecedented situation |

## Part 3: Facilitator Responsibilities

### The Facilitator's Sacred Duties

The facilitator is **not a participant**. They are the guardian of the process.

#### Before the Session:
1. **Verify Appropriateness**: Run the contraindication checklist
2. **Select Personas**: Choose that create genuine tension (use Domain Packs or MVD)
3. **Brief Participants**: Ensure everyone understands their role
4. **Prepare the Question**: Frame the decision clearly and neutrally

#### During the Session:
1. **Protect Dissent**: Ensure unpopular views get full expression
2. **Manage Time**: Keep phases on track without rushing substance
3. **Balance Voice**: No persona should dominate
4. **Name Dynamics**: If groupthink emerges, name it
5. **Hold Tension**: Don't rush to resolution; let disagreement breathe

#### After the Session:
1. **Capture Synthesis**: Document what emerged
2. **Track Decision**: Note the decision for later audit
3. **Invite Reflection**: What worked? What didn't?
4. **Protect Confidentiality**: What was said stays in the room

---

### The Eight Facilitator Red Lines

**Stop the session if:**

1. **Psychological safety breaks down** — Someone is genuinely distressed
2. **Power dynamics override process** — Senior voice silencing dissent
3. **The decision is already made** — Process is being used to rubber-stamp
4. **Personas are being weaponized** — Used to attack individuals, not ideas
5. **Confidentiality is breached** — Content is shared outside agreed bounds
6. **Time pressure distorts quality** — Rushing produces theater, not insight
7. **Framework Critic (PROBE) raises fundamental concern** — The meta-level challenge is valid
8. **Genuine harm is being planned** — Ethical lines are being crossed

---

## Part 4: The Sacred Elements

### What Cannot Be Traded Away

Some elements of SPAR are non-negotiable. They define authentic practice:

#### 1. **Genuine Disagreement**
> The personas must actually conflict. Polite variations are not debate. If everyone is saying basically the same thing differently, the dialectic has failed.

#### 2. **Voice for the Absent**
> Someone must speak for those not in the room. The Advocate archetype is not optional. Decisions without representation are decisions that create harm.

#### 3. **Synthesis, Not Victory**
> The goal is not for one persona to "win." The goal is to integrate insights into something none could reach alone. Synthesis honors all perspectives.

#### 4. **Epistemic Humility**
> Every conclusion is provisional. Every synthesis might be wrong. The Framework Critic (PROBE) exists to remind us: even this methodology has blind spots.

#### 5. **The Tamil Anchor**
> *"நாலு பேரு நாலு விதமா பேசுவாங்க"* — "Four people speak in four different ways."
> Diversity of voice is not a bug; it is the feature. Homogeneity of thought is the enemy.

---

## Part 5: Ethical Boundaries

### What SPAR Must Never Become

| ❌ SPAR Must Never Be Used To: | Why |
|-------------------------------|-----|
| Manufacture consensus where none exists | Suppresses genuine disagreement |
| Provide cover for predetermined decisions | Dishonors the dialectic |
| Attack individuals rather than ideas | Weaponizes disagreement |
| Exclude uncomfortable perspectives | Defeats the purpose of structured dissent |
| Create appearance of rigor without substance | Performance theater, not practice |
| Avoid human conversation by delegating to process | "Have the human conversation first" — GRACE Principle (Reveal) |

---

### When to Walk Away

A practitioner should refuse to facilitate SPAR when:

1. The decision has already been made
2. The purpose is to create documentation, not insight
3. Psychological safety is not present
4. The client wants validation, not challenge
5. Ethical lines would be crossed by any outcome

**Walking away is sometimes the most ethical choice.**
