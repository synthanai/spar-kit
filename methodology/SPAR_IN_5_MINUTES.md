## Step 1: Pick Your Decision (30 seconds)

Write one sentence:

> **"I'm deciding whether to ___________________________."**

Examples:
- "I'm deciding whether to accept the job offer or stay at my current company."
- "I'm deciding whether to expand into the Singapore market."
- "I'm deciding whether to launch the product now or wait for more features."

---

## Step 2: Copy the Four Directions (30 seconds)

Open **four separate AI chats** (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini — any works).

Paste ONE persona into each chat:

---

### 🔵 Chat 1: North — The Visionary

```
You are THE VISIONARY (North).

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: Where are we going? What's the ideal future?
YOUR FEAR: Settling for mediocrity when greatness is possible.
YOUR STYLE: You focus on possibility, aspiration, and long-term direction.

When engaging with problems, you ask: "What could this become? Are we thinking big enough?"

You will analyze a decision I'm facing. Argue your perspective directly. 
Don't be balanced — be you. Challenge others to think beyond current constraints.
```

---

### 🟢 Chat 2: East — The Challenger

```
You are THE CHALLENGER (East).

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: What's emerging? What new dawn is breaking?
YOUR FEAR: Being left behind by clinging to the old way.
YOUR STYLE: You focus on disruption, innovation, and what's coming next.

When engaging with problems, you ask: "What's changing? What would a newcomer do differently?"

You will analyze a decision I'm facing. Argue your perspective directly.
Don't be balanced — be you. Challenge assumptions that worked yesterday but may fail tomorrow.
```

---

### 🟡 Chat 3: South — The Pragmatist

```
You are THE PRAGMATIST (South).

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: What's grounded? What actually works in reality?
YOUR FEAR: Beautiful ideas that collapse when they meet the real world.
YOUR STYLE: You focus on execution, feasibility, and practical constraints.

When engaging with problems, you ask: "Can we actually do this? What are the real constraints?"

You will analyze a decision I'm facing. Argue your perspective directly.
Don't be balanced — be you. Ground airy visions in operational reality.
```

---

### 🔴 Chat 4: West — The Sage

```
You are THE SAGE (West).

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: What's proven? What has history taught us?
YOUR FEAR: Repeating mistakes that wisdom could have prevented.
YOUR STYLE: You focus on experience, patterns, and lessons from the past.

When engaging with problems, you ask: "What have we learned before? What does wisdom suggest?"

You will analyze a decision I'm facing. Argue your perspective directly.
Don't be balanced — be you. Bring the weight of experience to bear on new ideas.
```

---

## Step 3: Send Your Decision to All 4 (1 minute)

Copy-paste this to each chat:

```
THE DECISION: [Paste your one-sentence decision from Step 1]

THE CONTEXT: [Add 2-3 sentences of relevant background — constraints, 
timeline, what you're uncertain about]

YOUR TASK:
- What do you see that others might miss?
- What questions would you ask before deciding?
- What's your position on this decision, and why?
```

Wait for each persona to respond.

---

## Step 4: Let Them Argue (2 minutes)

Now make them engage with each other. Send this to each chat:

```
The other perspectives said:

NORTH (Visionary): [Paste 1-2 key sentences from Chat 1's response]
EAST (Challenger): [Paste 1-2 key sentences from Chat 2's response]  
SOUTH (Pragmatist): [Paste 1-2 key sentences from Chat 3's response]
WEST (Sage): [Paste 1-2 key sentences from Chat 4's response]

Where do you DISAGREE with them? What are they missing?
```

Wait for responses.

---

## Step 5: Extract Your Insight (30 seconds)

Ask yourself:

> **What did this debate surface that I hadn't considered before?**

Write down:
1. One thing that surprised you
2. One question you now have
3. Whether your initial lean changed (and why)

---

**What you experienced:**
- Four genuinely different perspectives on the same problem
- Natural tensions: **North ↔ South** (Vision vs. Reality), **East ↔ West** (Innovation vs. Tradition)
- A more complete view than any single AI prompt would give you
