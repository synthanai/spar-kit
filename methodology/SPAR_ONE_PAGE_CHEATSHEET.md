## The 2-Minute SPAR

### Step 1: State Your Decision
*"I'm considering [X]"*

### Step 2: Ask Four Questions

| Direction | Question | Time |
|-----------|----------|------|
| 🔵 **North** | "What would someone who thinks MUCH BIGGER say?" | 30 sec |
| 🟢 **East** | "What would a disruptive newcomer do differently?" | 30 sec |
| 🟡 **South** | "What would a skeptical realist point out?" | 30 sec |
| 🔴 **West** | "What does experience and history warn against?" | 30 sec |

### Step 3: Notice What Surprised You
*The tension IS the insight.*

## The 5-Minute Meeting SPAR

Before closing any decision:

> **"Wait. What would someone who disagrees with us say?"**

Then give that perspective 60 seconds of genuine consideration.

---

## The 30-Minute Deep SPAR

1. **Define the decision** (5 min)
2. **Assign 4 people to argue positions they DON'T naturally hold** (5 min each = 20 min)
3. **Synthesize: What did we learn?** (5 min)

## When NOT to Use SPAR

❌ **Time-critical emergencies** — Just decide  
❌ **Matters of expertise** — Trust the expert  
❌ **Personal taste** — No debate needed  
❌ **When you just need to vent** — That's not SPAR

## The One Habit
