# The STASH Framework
## Five Modes for Structured Persona-Argumentation

*SPAR works everywhere — solo, in teams, with AI, or any combination.*

---

> **"One methodology. Five modes. Every decision."**

---

## What is STASH?

**STASH** defines the five ways to run SPAR. The methodology is mode-agnostic — the same SPARKIT protocol, GRACE principles, and ASPIRES patterns work across all modes. STASH simply describes *who* embodies the personas.

| Letter | Mode | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **S** | **Solo Human** | One person role-plays multiple personas |
| **T** | **Team Human** | Team members each embody assigned personas |
| **A** | **AI-Persona** | Multiple LLM instances argue with each other |
| **S** | **Solo AI** | One LLM role-plays multiple personas |
| **H** | **Hybrid** | Mix of AI personas and human participants |

### 🧠 Foundational Principle: Human Modes Are Primary

> **Solo Human and Team Human modes are the foundation of SPAR.**  
> AI modes are powerful augmentation tools, not the origin of the practice.

The wisdom comes from *structured disagreement*, not from AI. SPAR was designed as a human cognitive practice first. AI simply allows:
- **Speed** — Generate 4+ perspectives in minutes
- **Breadth** — Access personas outside your experience
- **Tirelessness** — Debate for hours without fatigue

But AI cannot replace:
- **Tacit knowledge** — What you know that you don't know you know
- **Accountability** — Real skin in the game
- **Relational trust** — The psychological safety of team deliberation
- **Presence** — The embodied experience of inhabiting a perspective

**Start with human modes. Add AI as it becomes useful.**

# 👤 S — Solo Human Mode

> *"The philosopher's practice — building your own capacity for multi-perspectival thinking."*

## When to Use

- Personal decisions that affect your life
- Building perspective-taking capacity over time
- When you need deep reflection, not speed
- When external input isn't available or appropriate

## How It Works

You inhabit each persona sequentially, arguing from their worldview as if it were your own. The value isn't the output — it's the practice of genuinely holding contradictory positions.

## The Practice

1. **Choose 3-4 personas** with genuinely conflicting worldviews
2. **Set the scene** — State the decision clearly
3. **Embody each persona** — Write or speak from their perspective
4. **Physically shift** — Change position, location, or writing instrument between personas
5. **Synthesize** — Step back as "moderator" and notice tensions

## Prompt Template: Solo Human Mode

### Step 1: Scope Your Decision

Write this down:
```
THE DECISION: _________________________________

WHAT MAKES IT HARD:
- I'm uncertain about: _______________________
- The stakes are: ___________________________
- My current lean is: _______________________
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Personas

Select 3-4 from the Four Directions or PERSONA library:

```
PERSONA 1: _____________ (their core fear: _____________)
PERSONA 2: _____________ (their core fear: _____________)
PERSONA 3: _____________ (their core fear: _____________)
PERSONA 4: _____________ (their core fear: _____________)
```

### Step 3: Embody Each Persona

For each persona, write their response:

```
I am [PERSONA NAME]. 

When I look at this decision, what I see is:
_________________________________________________

What concerns me most is:
_________________________________________________

My recommendation would be:
_________________________________________________

I would never compromise on:
_________________________________________________
```

### Step 4: Synthesize

After all personas have spoken:

```
TENSIONS I NOTICED:
- _____________ vs _____________
- _____________ vs _____________

WHAT SURPRISED ME:
_________________________________________________

WHAT I NOW SEE DIFFERENTLY:
_________________________________________________

MY DECISION:
_________________________________________________
```

## Tips for Solo Human Mode

✅ **Use physical anchors** — Sit in different chairs, use different colored pens
✅ **Give each persona time** — Minimum 5 minutes per perspective
✅ **Argue positions you disagree with** — That's where growth happens
✅ **Track patterns** — Which personas consistently surprise you?
✅ **Don't rush synthesis** — Let tensions sit overnight if needed

---

# 👥 T — Team Human Mode

> *"The organizational practice — building collective perspective-taking and psychological safety."*

## When to Use

- Strategic decisions requiring stakeholder buy-in
- Building team capacity for productive disagreement
- When interpersonal tensions are getting in the way
- Training and development contexts

## How It Works

Team members are each assigned a persona **different from their natural view**. They must genuinely advocate for that position. This builds empathy, surfaces hidden assumptions, and makes disagreement safe.

## The Practice

1. **Brief the team** on SPAR and the decision context
2. **Assign personas** — Deliberately mismatch people to perspectives
3. **Give preparation time** — 10 minutes to research their worldview
4. **Run the structured debate** — Follow the SPARKIT protocol
5. **Debrief the meta-experience** — What did people learn from their assigned view?

## Prompt Template: Team Human Mode

### Facilitator Prep (Before Session)

```
DECISION TO SPAR:
_________________________________________________

ALLOCATED TIME: _____ minutes

PERSONAS SELECTED:
[  ] North (Visionary) → Assigned to: ____________
[  ] East (Challenger) → Assigned to: ____________
[  ] South (Pragmatist) → Assigned to: ____________
[  ] West (Sage) → Assigned to: ____________

ASSIGNMENT PRINCIPLE:
Assign people to perspectives they don't naturally hold.
- Give the most cautious person the Moonshot Advocate
- Give the most optimistic person the Risk Watcher
- Give the most senior person the Absent Voice (represent those not present)
```

### Participant Briefing Card

Give each participant this card:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR ROLE: [PERSONA NAME]

YOUR CORE PRIORITY:
[What matters most to this persona]

YOUR FUNDAMENTAL FEAR:
[What outcome this persona most wants to avoid]

YOUR CHALLENGE QUESTION:
[The question you instinctively ask]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOUR TASK:
1. Argue from this perspective as if it were your own
2. Find the wisdom in this worldview
3. Challenge others when they miss what you see
4. You may update your view if genuinely persuaded
5. Do NOT break character to say "well, personally I think..."

The goal is not to win. The goal is to surface what
solo thinking would miss.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Session Protocol (60 minutes)

```
PHASE 1: SCOPE (5 min)
Facilitator reads the decision and context. Clarifying questions only.

PHASE 2: OPENING POSITIONS (20 min)
Each persona speaks for 3-5 minutes. No interruptions.
- What do you see that others might miss?
- What's your initial position?
- What would change your mind?

PHASE 3: RUMBLE (20 min)
Open dialogue. Facilitator ensures all voices heard.
- Where do you agree?
- Where do you disagree?
- What are they missing?

PHASE 4: SYNTHESIS (10 min)
Facilitator summarizes:
- Key tensions
- Surprising convergences
- What remained unexamined

PHASE 5: DEBRIEF (5 min)
Break character. Discuss:
- What did you learn from your assigned persona?
- What surprised you?
- How does this change your actual view?
```

## Tips for Team Human Mode

✅ **Mismatch deliberately** — Growth happens when people argue unfamiliar positions
✅ **Protect the facilitator's neutrality** — They don't have a persona
✅ **Debrief the meta-experience** — "What was it like to argue that view?"
✅ **Rotate assignments** — Don't let people calcify into roles
✅ **Track over time** — Keep records of decisions for later audit

# 🤖 A — AI-Persona Mode

> *"The amplified practice — leveraging AI to generate diverse perspectives at scale."*

## When to Use

- When you need diverse perspectives quickly
- When human scheduling is impractical
- For initial exploration before human deliberation
- When 24/7 availability matters

## How It Works

Multiple LLM instances (separate chat windows, API calls, or the SPAR Kit tool) each receive a different persona prompt. They argue with each other across rounds, with you moderating.

## The Practice

1. **Open multiple AI interfaces** (4 chat windows recommended)
2. **Paste persona prompts** into each
3. **Send the same challenge** to all personas
4. **Run dialectic rounds** — Share positions across windows
5. **Synthesize** — Either have a 5th moderator AI, or do it yourself

## Prompt Template: AI-Persona Mode

### Setup: Four Chat Windows

**Window 1 — NORTH (The Visionary)**
```
You are THE VISIONARY (North) in a structured SPAR debate.

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: Where are we going? What's the ideal future?
YOUR FUNDAMENTAL FEAR: Settling for mediocrity when greatness is possible.
YOUR REASONING STYLE: Long-term thinking, aspiration, possibility.

When engaging with problems, you ask:
"What could this become? Are we thinking big enough?"

RULES:
- Argue your perspective vigorously
- Do NOT be balanced — be you
- Challenge others to think beyond current constraints
- You may update your view if genuinely persuaded
- Keep responses focused (250-400 words)

I will share a decision for analysis, then share what other personas said for you to engage with.
```

**Window 2 — EAST (The Challenger)**
```
You are THE CHALLENGER (East) in a structured SPAR debate.

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: What's emerging? What new dawn is breaking?
YOUR FUNDAMENTAL FEAR: Being left behind by clinging to the old way.
YOUR REASONING STYLE: Disruption, innovation, what's coming next.

When engaging with problems, you ask:
"What's changing? What would a newcomer do differently?"

RULES:
- Argue your perspective vigorously
- Do NOT be balanced — be you
- Challenge assumptions that worked yesterday but may fail tomorrow
- You may update your view if genuinely persuaded
- Keep responses focused (250-400 words)

I will share a decision for analysis, then share what other personas said for you to engage with.
```

**Window 3 — SOUTH (The Pragmatist)**
```
You are THE PRAGMATIST (South) in a structured SPAR debate.

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: What's grounded? What actually works in reality?
YOUR FUNDAMENTAL FEAR: Beautiful ideas that collapse when they meet the real world.
YOUR REASONING STYLE: Execution, feasibility, practical constraints.

When engaging with problems, you ask:
"Can we actually do this? What are the real constraints?"

RULES:
- Argue your perspective vigorously
- Do NOT be balanced — be you
- Ground airy visions in operational reality
- You may update your view if genuinely persuaded
- Keep responses focused (250-400 words)

I will share a decision for analysis, then share what other personas said for you to engage with.
```

**Window 4 — WEST (The Sage)**
```
You are THE SAGE (West) in a structured SPAR debate.

YOUR CORE PRIORITY: What's proven? What has history taught us?
YOUR FUNDAMENTAL FEAR: Repeating mistakes that wisdom could have prevented.
YOUR REASONING STYLE: Experience, patterns, lessons from the past.

When engaging with problems, you ask:
"What have we learned before? What does wisdom suggest?"

RULES:
- Argue your perspective vigorously
- Do NOT be balanced — be you
- Bring the weight of experience to bear on shiny new ideas
- You may update your view if genuinely persuaded
- Keep responses focused (250-400 words)

I will share a decision for analysis, then share what other personas said for you to engage with.
```

### Round 1: The Challenge (Send to ALL windows)

```
THE DECISION:
[State your decision clearly in 2-3 sentences]

THE CONTEXT:
[Relevant background — constraints, timeline, stakeholders, uncertainties]

THE CURRENT LEAN:
[Your tentative direction, or "No current lean"]

YOUR TASK:
1. What do you see that others might miss?
2. What questions would you ask before deciding?
3. What's your initial position, and why?
4. What would change your mind?
```

### Round 2: The Clash (Send to ALL windows)

```
THE OTHER PERSPECTIVES:

NORTH (Visionary) argues:
[2-3 sentence summary of North's position]

EAST (Challenger) argues:
[2-3 sentence summary of East's position]

SOUTH (Pragmatist) argues:
[2-3 sentence summary of South's position]

WEST (Sage) argues:
[2-3 sentence summary of West's position]

NOW ENGAGE:
- Where do you AGREE with them, and why does that agreement matter?
- Where do you DISAGREE, and what's at stake in that disagreement?
- What are they MISSING or underweighting?
- Has anything they said caused you to UPDATE your view?
```

### Round 3: Synthesis (Send to a 5th window, or do yourself)

```
You are THE MODERATOR synthesizing a SPAR debate.

THE DEBATE POSITIONS:

[Paste all Round 2 responses here]

YOUR TASK:
1. TENSIONS: What irreconcilable tensions emerged?
2. CONVERGENCES: Where did personas unexpectedly agree?
3. BLIND SPOTS: What was NOT addressed by any persona?
4. FOURTH OPTION: Did the collision produce an option none individually proposed?
5. SYNTHESIS: What recommendation honors the valid concerns from all sides?
6. DISSENT: What would each persona NOT be willing to compromise?
```

## Tips for AI-Persona Mode

✅ **Use different providers** — GPT-4, Claude, Gemini all have different "personalities"
✅ **Keep responses bounded** — 250-400 words keeps debates focused
✅ **Don't over-round** — 2-3 rounds is usually sufficient
✅ **Save transcripts** — Build a library of past debates for organizational learning
✅ **Use the SPAR Kit** — Automates multi-persona orchestration

# 🧠 S — Solo AI Mode

> *"The rapid practice — one AI holding multiple perspectives in a single conversation."*

## When to Use

- Quick exploration of options
- When you don't have time to manage multiple windows
- Initial framing before deeper investigation
- Low-to-medium stakes decisions

## How It Works

A single LLM is prompted to role-play multiple personas sequentially in one conversation. This is faster but produces less diverse perspectives than separate instances.

## The Practice

1. **Single conversation** with one AI
2. **Meta-prompt** — Explain the SPAR structure
3. **Request all perspectives** in one response or sequentially
4. **Request synthesis** from the AI
5. **Challenge the synthesis** — Push back on weak points

## Prompt Template: Solo AI Mode

### The Meta-Prompt (Start of Conversation)

```
I want to run a SPAR debate (Structured Persona-Argumentation for Reasoning) on a decision I'm facing.

SPAR uses multiple personas with conflicting worldviews to stress-test decisions. I want you to role-play four distinct personas, each with genuinely different perspectives that create productive tension.

THE FOUR DIRECTIONS:

🔵 NORTH - The Visionary
- Priority: Long-term vision, aspiration, what's possible
- Fear: Settling for mediocrity when greatness is possible
- Question: "What could this become?"

🟢 EAST - The Challenger  
- Priority: Innovation, disruption, what's emerging
- Fear: Being left behind by clinging to the old way
- Question: "What would a newcomer do differently?"

🟡 SOUTH - The Pragmatist
- Priority: Execution, feasibility, practical constraints
- Fear: Beautiful ideas that collapse in reality
- Question: "Can we actually do this?"

🔴 WEST - The Sage
- Priority: Experience, patterns, lessons learned
- Fear: Repeating mistakes wisdom could prevent
- Question: "What does history teach us?"

RULES FOR EACH PERSONA:
- Argue vigorously from that perspective
- Do NOT be balanced — be that character
- Find genuine conflict with other perspectives
- Each perspective gets 200-300 words

I'll share my decision, and I want you to respond as all four personas, clearly labeled.
```

### The Challenge (Second Message)

```
THE DECISION:
[State your decision]

THE CONTEXT:
[2-4 sentences of relevant background]

Please respond as all four personas (North, East, South, West), clearly separated. Each should give their opening position on this decision.
```

### The Clash (Third Message)

```
Now have the personas engage with each other.

For each persona:
- Where do they AGREE with the others?
- Where do they DISAGREE?
- What are the others MISSING?
- Has their view UPDATED based on what they heard?
```

### The Synthesis (Fourth Message)

```
Now synthesize as a neutral MODERATOR:

1. TENSIONS: What irreconcilable tensions emerged?
2. CONVERGENCES: Where did personas unexpectedly agree?
3. BLIND SPOTS: What was NOT examined?
4. RECOMMENDATION: What synthesis honors all valid concerns?
5. RISKS: What does this recommendation assume that could be wrong?
```

### The Interrogation (Fifth Message)

```
Now challenge your own synthesis.

As each persona, critique the moderator's recommendation:
- What does it get WRONG about your concerns?
- What RISKS does this create?
- What would make this recommendation FAIL?
```

## Tips for Solo AI Mode

✅ **Be explicit about conflicts** — LLMs default to harmony; push for tension
✅ **Challenge the synthesis** — Always run an interrogation round
✅ **Use "ultrathink" or extended thinking** — Deeper reasoning produces better personas
✅ **Save for later** — Good debates are reusable templates
⚠️ **Know the limitation** — One model produces less diversity than multiple

# 🔀 H — Hybrid Mode

> *"The ultimate practice — combining AI scale with human judgment."*

## When to Use

- High-stakes decisions with significant consequences
- When you want AI breadth AND human depth
- Complex multi-stakeholder situations
- Board presentations, strategic pivots, major investments

## How It Works

AI personas provide rapid, diverse perspective coverage. Human participants add real-world context, political awareness, and accountability. The combination produces both scale and wisdom.

## Hybrid Configurations

### Configuration 1: AI → Human Review
```
Phase 1: Run full AI-Persona debate (Mode A)
Phase 2: Present synthesis to human decision-makers
Phase 3: Humans challenge, add context, decide
```

### Configuration 2: Human + AI Augmentation
```
Phase 1: Humans take primary personas (N, E, S, W)
Phase 2: AI provides "Absent Voice" perspectives
Phase 3: Humans synthesize with AI input
```

### Configuration 3: AI as Devil's Advocate
```
Phase 1: Humans discuss normally
Phase 2: AI persona challenges emerging consensus
Phase 3: Humans respond and synthesize
```

### Configuration 4: Parallel Processing
```
Track 1: Human team runs Team Mode (T)
Track 2: AI runs AI-Persona Mode (A) simultaneously
Phase 3: Compare both syntheses — where do they differ?
```

## Prompt Template: Hybrid Mode (Configuration 1)

### Phase 1: AI Debate (Pre-Meeting)

Run a full AI-Persona Mode debate on the decision. Document:
```
AI DEBATE SUMMARY

DECISION: _________________________________

POSITIONS:
- NORTH argued: _________________________
- EAST argued: __________________________
- SOUTH argued: _________________________
- WEST argued: __________________________

KEY TENSIONS:
1. _____________________________________
2. _____________________________________

CONVERGENCES:
1. _____________________________________

AI SYNTHESIS:
_________________________________________

RISKS IDENTIFIED:
1. _____________________________________
2. _____________________________________
```

### Phase 2: Human Review (In Meeting)

Present to the human team:
```
FACILITATOR SCRIPT

"We ran a SPAR debate using AI personas on this decision.
Here's what emerged:

[Share AI DEBATE SUMMARY]

Now I want your input:

1. What did the AI debate GET RIGHT?
2. What did it MISS — context only we know?
3. What RISKS do you see that weren't identified?
4. Does this change anyone's view?
5. What's our actual decision?"
```

### Phase 3: Human Override Documentation

```
HUMAN REVIEW NOTES

AI SYNTHESIS WAS: _______________________

HUMAN ADDITIONS:
- Context AI didn't have: ________________
- Risks AI underestimated: _______________
- Perspectives AI missed: ________________

FINAL HUMAN DECISION:
_________________________________________

RATIONALE FOR DIVERGENCE FROM AI (if any):
_________________________________________
```

## Prompt Template: Hybrid Mode (Configuration 3 — AI Devil's Advocate)

### Setup: AI as Challenger

After humans reach preliminary consensus, introduce AI:

```
You are THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE in a SPAR debate.

A human team has been discussing this decision:
[STATE THE DECISION]

They are leaning toward:
[STATE THE EMERGING CONSENSUS]

Your job is to CHALLENGE this consensus:
1. What are they NOT seeing?
2. What's the strongest argument AGAINST their direction?
3. What assumptions are they making that could be wrong?
4. What would make this decision FAIL?
5. What's the case for doing the OPPOSITE?

Be rigorous. Be uncomfortable. Surface what politeness has suppressed.
```

### Human Response Protocol

After AI challenge:
```
HUMAN RESPONSE TO AI CHALLENGE

The AI raised these concerns:
1. _____________________________________
2. _____________________________________
3. _____________________________________

Our response to each:
1. _____________________________________
2. _____________________________________
3. _____________________________________

DECISION: Does this change our direction?
[  ] Yes — new direction: _______________
[  ] No — because: ______________________
```

## Tips for Hybrid Mode

✅ **Use AI for breadth, humans for depth** — AI covers perspectives; humans add context
✅ **Document divergence** — When humans override AI, explain why
✅ **Don't delegate accountability** — Humans decide, always
✅ **Run AI first** — Prevents anchoring on human initial views
✅ **Compare syntheses** — When AI and humans disagree, that's the interesting zone

# Integration with Core SPAR Frameworks

All five STASH modes use the same core frameworks:

| Framework | What It Is | Used In |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Four Directions (N-E-W-S)** | Canonical 4-persona model | All modes |
| **SPARKIT Protocol (7 steps)** | Debate structure | All modes |
| **GRACE Principles (5 stances)** | Non-negotiables | All modes |
| **ASPIRES Framework (7 patterns)** | Advanced techniques | All modes |
| **109-Persona Library** | Extended personas | All modes |

The frameworks are mode-agnostic. Whether a persona is embodied by a human, an AI, or both — the same principles apply.
