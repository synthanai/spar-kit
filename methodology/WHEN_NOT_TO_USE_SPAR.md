# When NOT to Use SPAR
## Boundary Conditions for Methodology Integrity

> **Every powerful tool must know its limits. SPAR is no exception.**

---

## 🚫 Clear Contraindications

### 1. Time-Critical Emergencies

**Don't SPAR when the building is on fire.**

- Medical emergencies: Act, don't deliberate
- Security incidents: Contain, then analyze
- Cascading failures: Intervene now, synthesize later

**The Rule**: If delay causes irreversible harm, SPAR is the wrong mode.

---

### 2. Pure Expertise Domains

**Don't SPAR what the expert already knows.**

- "Should we use this surgical technique?" → Ask the surgeon
- "Is this code secure?" → Ask the security expert
- "Will this load-bearing wall work?" → Ask the structural engineer

**The Rule**: SPAR generates perspectives, not expertise. Don't crowdsource what requires specialization.

---

### 3. Matters of Personal Taste

**Don't SPAR your preferences.**

- "Should I prefer jazz or classical?"
- "What color should I paint my bedroom?"
- "Which vacation destination do I actually want?"

**The Rule**: If there's no "better answer," only your answer, SPAR is unnecessary overhead.

---

### 4. When the Decision Is Already Made

**Don't use SPAR as theater to justify conclusions.**

Signs you're doing this:
- You already know the outcome you want
- You're selecting personas that will agree with you
- The "debate" is really persuasion in costume

**The Rule**: SPAR is for genuine exploration, not political cover. If you're seeking validation, admit it and skip the performance.

---

### 5. When Participants Are Not Psychologically Safe

**Don't SPAR in hostile environments.**

SPAR requires:
- Genuine willingness to change one's mind
- Ability to argue uncomfortable positions without retaliation
- Trust that dissent won't be punished later

If people are afraid to speak honestly, SPAR becomes theater at best, weaponized at worst.

**The Rule**: Psychological safety is a prerequisite, not an outcome.

---

### 6. Trivial Decisions

**Don't overthink the irreversible lunch order.**

- Where to eat tonight?
- Which font for the internal memo?
- Whether to take the stairs or elevator?

**The Rule**: SPAR is cognitive investment. Don't spend dollars on penny decisions.

---

### 7. When You Just Need to Vent

**SPAR is not therapy.**

Sometimes you need:
- A sympathetic ear
- Emotional validation
- Space to be irrational

SPAR provides none of these. It's structured confrontation with uncomfortable perspectives.

**The Rule**: Know the difference between "I need to process" and "I need to decide."

## ⚠️ Caution Zones (Use Carefully)

### When One Party Has Overwhelming Power

If a CEO "SPARs" with their direct reports, is the dissent genuine? 

**Mitigation**: Use anonymous inputs, external facilitators, or AI-persona mode to reduce power dynamics.

---

### When Emotions Are Running Hot

SPAR requires cognitive engagement, not fight-or-flight.

**Mitigation**: Invoke "Stillness Before Synthesis" — wait 24 hours, then deliberate.

---

### When Information Is Radically Asymmetric

If Person A has 10 years of data and Person B has an opinion, the "debate" is not a debate.

**Mitigation**: Brief all participants equally before the session. Asymmetry should be in perspective, not information.

---

### When Cultural Norms Forbid Public Disagreement

Not all cultures view open challenge as acceptable.

**Mitigation**: Solo modes (Solo Human, Solo AI) allow internal dialectic without cultural friction.

## ✅ When TO Use SPAR

This document focuses on the "no" — but for completeness:

| Situation | SPAR Mode |
|-----------|-----------|
| Strategic decisions with significant consequences | Tier 2: Full SPARKIT |
| Team decisions requiring buy-in | Team Human (T) |
| Personal decisions affecting your life | Solo Human (S) |
| Rapid exploration of options | AI-Persona (A) or Solo AI (S) |

## The Meta-Test

If you're unsure whether to SPAR, ask:

> **"Will genuine disagreement improve this decision?"**

- **If yes** → SPAR
- **If no** → Don't SPAR
- **If you're afraid of the answer** → Definitely SPAR
